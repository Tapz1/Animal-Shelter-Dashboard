# Animal-Shelter-Dashboard through client/server development

Functionality
This project uses MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to develop a Python application that utilizes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The primary function of this web app is for the international rescue-animal training company, Grazioso Salvare. It allows the user to filter the data based on the dogs that are most preferred for the type of rescue situation and populate that data in a table, map and pie chart.

MongoDB was used as the model component because it provides an efficient way to have a database through documents rather than hosting a separate relational database somewhere. In this project, I utilize the Dash framework to provide in-line html functions within python which avoids having to have separate files dedicated solely to html.

Completing this project required the following steps:
-	Setting up the MongoDB and importing the necessary data
-	Creating a user
-	Creating the Python CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions in a separate .py file
-	Running a IPYNB script that incorporates all of the components of the web app by bringing in those CRUD functions and setting up the Dash framework to display the data properly

The biggest challenge that I seemed to have faced was ensuring that the python methods did an accurate job of fetching to filter the data from the database itself with accurate queries.
